## HubSpot => SFDC Integration

This integration is built for importing contacts from HubSpot CRM to SalesForce. When a customer initially install the product, a manual full import is performed via /sync. After that, differential syncronization is performed each time a HubSpot contact is created via the use of webhooks.
